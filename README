Trying out WebGL.

Making a voxel game. 

I want to test two ideas specifically:
* Voxel level-of-detail, so you can see to the horizon
  (Minecraft never lets you see further than ~25 or so 16x16 chunks)
* Peer-to-peer updates, probably using Webtorrent

I want a single world. Everyone who visits the right URL can play. 

The game will be a collection of npm modules that each does just one thing.
I want it to be easy to hack, modify, and reuse.

Goals for the modules:
* lighter than 3js. everything that's memory intensive should be Float32Array, etc, not JS objects.
