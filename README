Making a voxel game.

## tech

I want to test out some ideas:

* Voxel level-of-detail, so you can see to the horizon
  (Minecraft never lets you see further than ~25 or so 16x16 chunks)
* Browser based. Straight JS + WebGL, no emscripten, no WebAssembly, no Three.js, no voxel.js
* Single  world. Everyone who visits the right URL can play.

The game will be built on a collection of npm modules that each does just one thing.

I want it to be easy to hack, modify, and reuse. Unclear whether it will be open source.

I want the modules to be lighter than 3js. Everything that's memory intensive should use typed arrays.
