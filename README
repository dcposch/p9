Trying out WebGL

Next steps:
* clean up shaders
* make a demo game
* add a server-side component to the game with node and mongo
* run it on heroku + mongohq
* keep the webgl backend clean and small
* ...make it suck less
* ...add semver


Goals for the library:
* lighter than 3js. everything that's memory intensive should be Float32Array, etc, not JS objects.
* provide shaders for a simple fixed-function pipeline
* respect opengl's naming conventions
* provide utils for loading models and textures
* mipmapping, filtering


Not goals. These can be implemented somewhere else, outside of DCGL:
* scene graph (octree, kdtree)
* terrain generation
* jquery-style selectors to address models, find neighbors, modify properties, etc
* physics
* animation (dcgl just includes requestAnimFrame())
* hooks for d3?
